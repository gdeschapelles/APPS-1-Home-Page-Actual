# APPS-1-Home-Page-Actual
On my Home Page, I used the Jumbotron Bootstrap Template to give my site the look I wanted for it.  Also, I filled in where the articles would go and the tabs of my site.  For my next step, I will do the secondary pages with a similar format and and start linking different news sites to my site in order to get the articles there.
